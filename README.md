# Monthly CVE Statistics

This repository will contain the Jupyter notebooks I use to track CVE data points from [NVD](https://nvd.nist.gov/) throughout the year. My sugesstion is to open these notebooks in [Google Colab](https://colab.google.com).

Please feel free to open a PR or Issue with any questions or impromvements.
